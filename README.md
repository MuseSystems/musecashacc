This is a small extension designed to help with creating accounting entries needed to operate cash basis accounting in the xTuple
ERP.  

Please note that while this package is released for general consumption, it is likely a terrible idea to actually use it.  
While feedback is welcome (much of my rationale for releasing it), it was meant for our business.

So if you do download and use this keep in mind:
1. This was made by technologists not CPAs or accountants.  It may well not produce remotely valid accounting entries.
2. We do not warrant or even stand by this product as-is for any purpose.  You use this at your own risk.  By using this you are openly accepting that you are likely doing something wrong.  
3. You have been warned.

If you are qualified to take a look and determine if it "does the right thing", please feel free to do so... we'd love to be able to release this as something we stand by.
